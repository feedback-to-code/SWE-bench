# Human Evaluation

on scorelab
first you have to install miniconda https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html

have THIS repo and our fork of [cwa-server](https://github.com/feedback-to-code/cwa-server) cloned in your home dir on scorelab side-by-side.

in THIS repo run `conda env create file=environement.yml` and activate the env.

in cwa server repo run `gh repo set-default` and set our fork as default.


in THIS repo go to `evaluation` dir.


run `python3 human_eval.py`

From here on follow what is written in the terminal and read carefully :)
